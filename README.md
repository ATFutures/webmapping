### Take this course
Whilst I continue creating the content and strucutre the course. If you like use it now, use the worksheets in the order they are numbered. 

Each worksheet is estimated to take half a day teaching but should be less than 2 hours self learning.

### Course content:

* Beginner
  * Why JS? (day 1)
  * Quick intro to JS (day 1)
  * Quick intro into NodeJS (day 1)
  * Quick intro into modern web front-end frameworks (ReactJS) (day 1)
  * A quick dive into ReactJS (day 2)
  * Web mapping (core of the course)  (day 2)
  * Visualizing data using Leaflet/MapBoxGL (day 2)
* Advanced
  * Coming...

### Repo structure (currently beginner only): 
* `worksheets` are the main content of the course. They are divided into four half-day's worth of effort.
* `html` includes the "standalone" code samples that you can view in a browser.
* `slides` are for me to teach the course but feel free to use them.

I cannot remember by whom and so I am unable to give credit where it seems due) that once a person has understood the way in which variables are used in programming, he has understood the quintessence of programming. ~ O.
