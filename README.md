# webmapping
Short course in web (browser) mapping using React

I think this could be a great place for a two day course to teach what I have learned in the past year. Using the power of React/JS to visualize spatial data. From plotting simple Markers to the use of http://kepler.gl/ dashbords to analyse spatial data complemented by [R4TS](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/R4TS).
